# 📝 TodoList App (Go + Frontend)

A simple **Todo List application** with a Go backend and a modern frontend.  
This project demonstrates full-stack development with clear separation of concerns:

- **Backend** → REST API built with Go  
- **Frontend** → (React/Next.js, or your chosen framework) for the UI
